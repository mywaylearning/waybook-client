# Waybook Client

The Waybook client application is built on top of the [Ionic Framework](http://www.ionicframework.com/), which itself is built on [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org/) and [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/).

By using these underlying libraries, we're able to build a hybrid application which works in the desktop browser, the mobile browser, and can be built for native deployment on iOS and Android platforms.
