    <h1>Forming the right habits are critical for success.</h1>
    <p>What you repeatedly do, ultimately defines the person you become. You can set goals to form new habits. Habits recur in the following cycle:</p>
    <p class="text-center">cue → routine → reward</p>
    <p>Habits are trigged by <strong>CUES</strong> such as time, place, another activity, a feeling, a sound, a smell, etc.. The <strong>ROUTINE</strong> is the habit itself. The <strong>REWARD</strong> is the beneficial consequence of the routine. The best rewards are a natural consequence.</p>
    <p>It may take a hundreds of times through this cycle for the routine to become a natural habit.</p>
