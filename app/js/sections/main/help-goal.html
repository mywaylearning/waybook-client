    <h1>Forming the right habits are critical for success.</h1>
    <p>What you repeatedly do, ultimately defines the person you become.</p>
    <p>Some goals are recurring, and are actually a goal to form a new habit. Habits recur in the following cycle:</p>
    <p class="text-center">cue → routine → reward</p>
    <p><strong>Cue:</strong> Habits are routines triggered by cues. Those cues can be a time, a place, another activity, a feeling, a sound, a smell, or something else. For example you hear the phone ring.</p>
    <p><strong>Routine:</strong> This is the habit itself. For example, you pick up the phone and say hello.</p>
    <p><strong>Rewards:</strong> The reward is the beneficial consequence of the routine. The best rewards are a natural consequence. For example, your reward is that your curiosity is satisfied, or you connect with another human.</p>
    <p>It may take a hundreds of times through this cycle for the routine to become a natural habit.</p>
